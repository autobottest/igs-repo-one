BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a rankin function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query.


Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common "stem". 

The default implemmentation uses the Porter2 stemmer from Snowball.  
You can add other Stemmer implementations, for example, CoreNLP or Lucene.
